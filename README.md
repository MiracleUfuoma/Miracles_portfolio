# Pizza Sales Report: Project Overview
Project's purpose is prediction of future values in a time series which are sales of a pizza company.

The values below were found using SQL
1. Total pizza sold
2. Total revenue
3. Average order
4. Average pizza per order
5. Total order

The above values were represented on KPI's in power BI for visualization.
The client requested for the top 5 pizzas with the most number of sales and the bottom 5 pizzas with the lowest number of sales and I was able to do this with column bar charts in power BI.
Using datetime functions,the monthly and daily trend of pizza sales were represented with line charts on piwer BI.
In conclusion,the thai chicken pizza contributed to maximum revenue. Since it had more sales and brought in more profits,it should be produced more so that it can create more profit.
The brii carr pizza is the worst seller. Production of this type of pizza should be stopped or reduced, since it brings in little or no profit for the organization.
